	abstract = {The system of reactions H3++HD↔H2D++H2 has been studied in a low-temperature multipole ion trap at a nominal temperature of 10K. The rate coefficient k1 for the forward reaction has been found to be 3.5×10−10cm3s−1 at 10K, a value significantly smaller than the currently accepted value of 1.5×10−9cm3s−1. The rate coefficient k−1 for the backward reaction has been found to be much higher than the value derived from the equilibrium coefficient of ∼10−18cm3s1. For normal-hydrogen, a value of k−1=4.9×10−11cm3s−1 has been deduced while for almost pure para-hydrogen (purity 99±1\%) the value drops to k−1=7.3×10−13cm3s−1. The results are discussed on the basis of the well-known energy levels of the involved molecules and the potential energy surface of the H4D+ intermediate. Zero-point energy plays a key role; however, there are additional complications due to the formation of rotationally excited H2D+, if even traces of ortho-H2 (o-H2) are present. The consequences of the results for the chemistry of cold clouds are illustrated using an evolutive gas-phase chemical model. There is strong evidence, that the new results significantly reduce the efficiency of isotope fractionation via gas-phase reactions. The experimental results also indicate the need for state-to-state rate coefficients in order to correctly simulate the o-H2 induced non-equilibrium conditions prevailing both in the low temperature ion trap and in interstellar clouds.},

	abstract = {For the two reactions H- + D2 → D- + HD and D- + H2 → H- + HD, absolute integral and differential cross sections have been determined in a guided ion beam (GIB) apparatus. From the effective cross sections, measured in the translational energy range ET = 0.1−10 eV, thresholds for the onset of the reactions have been derived, indicating effective barrier heights of 350 ± 60 meV for H- + D2 and 330 ± 60 meV for D- + H2. These values are substantially lower than previously reported experimental and theoretical data. Comparison of the integral cross sections for the two isotopic variants reveals a significant isotope effect. The collision of the light ion with the heavy molecule leads to a cross section which is almost a factor of 2 smaller than for D- reacting with H2. Possible experimental effects discriminating D- versus H- are discussed. The recently reported differential cross section for H- + D2 which has been obtained with a crossed beam experiment is in good accordance with the present data determined with the GIB technique. A new result is that, at small collision energies, the angular dependence is very similar for both isotopic variants. In view of the quite large isotopic effect for the integral cross sections this is not self-evident. All these detailed results pose a challenge to full quantum dynamical scattering theory of the H3− collision system.},

These observations reveal a surprisingly rich array of molecular species and attest to a complex chemistry taking place in the harsh environment of the interstellar medium of galaxies. Molecules are truly everywhere and an important component of interstellar gas. This review surveys molecular observations in the various spectral windows and summarizes the chemical and physical processes involved in the formation and evolution of interstellar molecules. The rich organic inventory of space reflects the multitude of chemical processes involved that, on the one hand, build up molecules an atom at a time and, on the other hand, break down large molecules injected by stars to smaller fragments. Both this bottom-up and the trickle-down chemistry are reviewed. The emphasis is on understanding the characteristics of complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules and fullerenes and their role in chemistry as well as the intricate interaction of gas-phase ion-molecule and neutral-neutral reactions and the chemistry taking place on grain surfaces in dense clouds in setting the organic inventory of regions of star and planet formation and their implications for the chemical history of the Solar System.

In general, such tunnelling reactions are challenging to calculate theoretically, given the high dimensionality of the quantum dynamics, and also very difficult to identify experimentally2–4. Hydrogenic systems, however, allow for accurate first-principles calculations. In this way the rate of the gas-phase proton-transfer tunnelling reaction of hydrogen molecules with deuterium anions, H2 + D− → H− + HD, has been calculated5, but has so far lacked experimental verification. Here we present high-sensitivity measurements of the reaction rate carried out in a cryogenic 22-pole ion trap. We observe an extremely low rate constant of (5.2 ± 1.6) × 10−20 cm3 s−1. This measured value agrees with quantum tunnelling calculations, serving as a benchmark for molecular theory and advancing the understanding of fundamental collision processes. A deviation of the reaction rate from linear scaling, which is observed at high H2 densities, can be traced back to previously unobserved heating dynamics in radiofrequency ion traps.},

Below 50 K the OH- rotational temperature shows deviations from the buffer gas temperature, and possible causes for this are discussed. For H 3O2- vibrational cooling of the lowest vibrational quantum states into the vibrational ground state is observed.

For most of these applications it is important to know the translational and internal temperatures of the trapped ions.

The measured rotational temperatures show a termination of the thermalisation with the buffer gas around 25K, independent of mass ratio and confinement potential of the trap. Different possible explanations for this incomplete thermalisation are discussed, among them the thermalisation of the buffer gas, room temperature blackbody radiation or warm gas entering the trap, and heating due to energy transfer from rotationally excited hydrogen molecules.},

With our recently developed method we have achieved a precision of better than 25\% on these absolute cross sections. The experiments have been carried out by means of photodetachment tomography of the mass-selected molecular anions in a multipole radio-frequency ion trap. The measured absolute cross sections are in accordance with the empirical scaling law of Millar et al. and have allowed us to determine its free parameters.

Using thermalized negative Cl− ions we find that the evaporative loss rate is proportional to a Boltzmann factor. This thermodynamic description allows us to extract the effective depth of the ion trap. As a function of the rf amplitude we find two distinct regimes related to the stability of motion of the trapped ions. For low amplitudes the entire trap allows for stable motion and the trap depth increases with the rf field. For larger rf amplitudes rapid energy transfer from the field to the ion motion can occur at large trap radii, which leads to a reduction of the effective trapping volume. In this regime the trap depth decreases again with increasing rf amplitude. We give an analytical parametrization of the trap depth for various multipole traps that allows predictions of the most favorable trapping conditions.},

An analysis of the evaporation rate was used to determine an effective trap depth as a function of the rf amplitude. This revealed that already for moderate rf amplitudes and low average stability parameter 𝜂 the loss of ions is driven by nonadiabatic motion of the fastest ions in the rf field. Here we present the details of the experimental procedure together with our experimental apparatus, which combines a 22-pole rf ion trap with tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry for ion selection and product analysis. We furthermore describe in detail the numerical and analytical models used in the interpretation of our results, which allows one to predict the most favorable trapping conditions in multipole rf ion traps.

The next five chapters provide a similar review of the basic physical processes that are important for star formation. Again, the goal is to provide a basis for what follows. The remaining chapters discuss star formation over a variety of scales, starting with the galactic scale and working down to the scales of individual stars and their disks. The book concludes with a brief discussion of the clearing of disks and the transition to planet formation. The book includes five problem sets, complete with solutions.},

By integrating over angles and summing over partial cross sections (for individual upsilon ' states of the HD product molecule), we determine the absolute total cross section of the reaction. The reaction has a threshold at Erel=0.42+or-0.12 eV. The cross section rises to a maximum of 2*10-16 cm2 at 1.5 eV and then rapidly decreases again.

The approach is based on accurate ab initio calculations of electronic bound and continuum states of the negative ion. The electronic continuum states are obtained with the complex-Kohn variational method. The benchmark calculation for the REA to the simplest negative ion CN−, which was recently observed in the interstellar medium, has produced a relatively low rate coefficient α(T)=7.3×10−16 cm3/s at T=30 K. Moreover, our results are shown to agree well with microscopic reversibility applied on a recent photodetachment experiment on CN−. Finally, the study confirms a previous assessment that the CN− ion is unlikely be formed by REA in the interstellar medium.},

	abstract = {In cosmology, recombination refers to the epoch during which charged electrons and protons first became bound to form electrically neutral hydrogen atoms. Recombination occurred about 378,000 years after the Big Bang (at a redshift of z = 1100). The word "recombination" is misleading, since the Big Bang theory doesn't posit that protons and electrons had been combined before, but the name exists for historical reasons since it was named before the Big Bang hypothesis became the primary theory of the birth of the universe.
Immediately after the Big Bang, the universe was a hot, dense plasma of photons, leptons, and quarks: the quark epoch. At 10−6 seconds, the Universe had expanded and cooled sufficiently to allow for the formation of protons: the hadron epoch. This plasma was effectively opaque to electromagnetic radiation due to Thomson scattering by free electrons, as the mean free path each photon could travel before encountering an electron was very short. This is the current state of the interior of the Sun. As the universe expanded, it also cooled. Eventually, the universe cooled to the point that the formation of neutral hydrogen was energetically favored, and the fraction of free electrons and protons as compared to neutral hydrogen decreased to a few parts in 10,000.
Recombination involves electrons binding to protons (hydrogen nuclei) to form neutral hydrogen atoms. Because direct recombinations to the ground state (lowest energy) of hydrogen are very inefficient, these hydrogen atoms generally form with the electrons in a high energy state, and the electrons quickly transition to their low energy state by emitting photons. Two main pathways exist: from the 2p state by emitting a Lyman-a photon – these photons will almost always be reabsorbed by another hydrogen atom in its ground state – or from the 2s state by emitting two photons, which is very slow.This production of photons is known as decoupling, which leads to recombination sometimes being called photon decoupling, but recombination and photon decoupling are distinct events. Once photons decoupled from matter, they traveled freely through the universe without interacting with matter and constitute what is observed today as cosmic microwave background radiation (in that sense, the cosmic background radiation is infrared and some red black-body radiation emitted when the universe was at a temperature of some 3000 K, redshifted by a factor of 1100 from the visible spectrum to the microwave spectrum).},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater}Following the recent detection of C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}6{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}H{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} in the laboratory and in space we have succeeded in studying the microwave spectrum of C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}H{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. We report here the first detection in space of this negative ion.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater}We have observed in the envelope of the carbon star IRC +10216 five lines corresponding to the {\textless}i{\textgreater}J{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 9-8, 11-10, 12-11, 14-13 and 15-14 rotational transitions of C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}H{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. The C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}H{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} lines have a cusped shape, denoting that this ion is formed in the outer part of the envelope, like its neutral counterpart C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}H.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater}The abundance of C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}H{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} in IRC+10216 is 1/6 of the abundance of C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}6{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}H{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} and 1/4200 of that of C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}H.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater}The detection of C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}H{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, after that of C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}6{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}H{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, confirms the theoretical prediction that C-chain anions are abundant in interstellar clouds and yields a first measurement of the electron radiative attachment rates.},

The anion CN{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} is identified by observing the {\textless}i{\textgreater}J{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 2–1 and {\textless}i{\textgreater}J{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 3–2 rotational transitions in the C-star envelope IRC +10216 with the IRAM 30-m telescope. The U-shaped line profiles indicate that CN{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, like the large anion C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}6{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}H{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, is formed in the outer regions of the envelope. Chemical and excitation model calculations suggest that this species forms from the reaction of large carbon anions with N atoms, rather than from the radiative attachment of an electron to CN, as is the case for large molecular anions. The unexpectedly high abundance derived for CN{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, 0.25\% relative to CN, indicates that its detection in other astronomical sources is likely. A parallel search for the small anion C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}H{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} remains inconclusive, despite the previous tentative identification of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}J{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 1–0 rotational transition. The abundance of C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}H{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} in IRC +10216 is found to be vanishingly small, {\textless}i{\textgreater}{\textless}{\textless}i/{\textgreater}0.0014\% relative to C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}H.},

	abstract = {We have developed an approach based on first principles to study the process of radiative electron attachment (REA) to linear molecules of astrophysical interest in collisions between the molecules and electrons at energies below 1 eV. The approach is based on accurate ab initio calculations of electronic bound and continuum states of the negative ion. The electronic continuum states are obtained with the complex-Kohn variational method. The benchmark calculation for the REA to the simplest negative ion CN−, which was recently observed in the interstellar medium, has produced a relatively low rate coefficient 𝛼⁡(𝑇)=7.3×10−16 cm3/s at 𝑇=30 K. Moreover, our results are shown to agree well with microscopic reversibility applied on a recent photodetachment experiment on CN−. Finally, the study confirms a previous assessment that the CN− ion is unlikely be formed by REA in the interstellar medium.},

The shape of the reactive potential energy surface suggests the most efficient approach of H− to be on a nearly collinear arrangement on the H-side of HCnN. Using simple transition state formulation of the reaction rates, which are obtained via calculation of the partition functions of each transition state configuration, provides a new non-Langevin behavior of the reaction which can help explain the unexpectedly large density of CN− formation found in observations. A similar procedure is also employed for the reaction of H− with HC3N and the differences in the results, indicating a lower efficiency of the latter reactivity compared with that for CN−, are discussed in this paper.},
