	abstract = {We derive and analyze a novel approach for modeling and computing the mechanical relaxation of incommensurate 2D heterostructures. Our approach parametrizes the relaxation pattern by the compact local configuration space rather than real space, thus bypassing the need for the standard supercell approximation and giving a true aperiodic atomistic configuration. Our model extends the computationally accessible regime of weakly coupled bilayers with similar orientations or lattice spacing, for example materials with a small relative twist where the widely studied large-scale moire patterns arise. Our model also makes possible the simulation of multi-layers for which no interlayer empirical atomistic potential exists, such as those composed of MoS2 layers, and more generally makes possible the simulation of the relaxation of multi-layer heterostructures for which a planar moire pattern does not exist.},

	abstract = {The system of reactions H3++HD↔H2D++H2 has been studied in a low-temperature multipole ion trap at a nominal temperature of 10K. The rate coefficient k1 for the forward reaction has been found to be 3.5×10−10cm3s−1 at 10K, a value significantly smaller than the currently accepted value of 1.5×10−9cm3s−1. The rate coefficient k−1 for the backward reaction has been found to be much higher than the value derived from the equilibrium coefficient of ∼10−18cm3s1. For normal-hydrogen, a value of k−1=4.9×10−11cm3s−1 has been deduced while for almost pure para-hydrogen (purity 99±1\%) the value drops to k−1=7.3×10−13cm3s−1. The results are discussed on the basis of the well-known energy levels of the involved molecules and the potential energy surface of the H4D+ intermediate. Zero-point energy plays a key role; however, there are additional complications due to the formation of rotationally excited H2D+, if even traces of ortho-H2 (o-H2) are present. The consequences of the results for the chemistry of cold clouds are illustrated using an evolutive gas-phase chemical model. There is strong evidence, that the new results significantly reduce the efficiency of isotope fractionation via gas-phase reactions. The experimental results also indicate the need for state-to-state rate coefficients in order to correctly simulate the o-H2 induced non-equilibrium conditions prevailing both in the low temperature ion trap and in interstellar clouds.},

	abstract = {For the two reactions H- + D2 → D- + HD and D- + H2 → H- + HD, absolute integral and differential cross sections have been determined in a guided ion beam (GIB) apparatus. From the effective cross sections, measured in the translational energy range ET = 0.1−10 eV, thresholds for the onset of the reactions have been derived, indicating effective barrier heights of 350 ± 60 meV for H- + D2 and 330 ± 60 meV for D- + H2. These values are substantially lower than previously reported experimental and theoretical data. Comparison of the integral cross sections for the two isotopic variants reveals a significant isotope effect. The collision of the light ion with the heavy molecule leads to a cross section which is almost a factor of 2 smaller than for D- reacting with H2. Possible experimental effects discriminating D- versus H- are discussed. The recently reported differential cross section for H- + D2 which has been obtained with a crossed beam experiment is in good accordance with the present data determined with the GIB technique. A new result is that, at small collision energies, the angular dependence is very similar for both isotopic variants. In view of the quite large isotopic effect for the integral cross sections this is not self-evident. All these detailed results pose a challenge to full quantum dynamical scattering theory of the H3− collision system.},

This review surveys molecular observations in the various spectral windows and summarizes the chemical and physical processes involved in the formation and evolution of interstellar molecules. The rich organic inventory of space reflects the multitude of chemical processes involved that, on the one hand, build up molecules an atom at a time and, on the other hand, break down large molecules injected by stars to smaller fragments. Both this bottom-up and the trickle-down chemistry are reviewed. The emphasis is on understanding the characteristics of complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules and fullerenes and their role in chemistry as well as the intricate interaction of gas-phase ion-molecule and neutral-neutral reactions and the chemistry taking place on grain surfaces in dense clouds in setting the organic inventory of regions of star and planet formation and their implications for the chemical history of the Solar System.

In general, such tunnelling reactions are challenging to calculate theoretically, given the high dimensionality of the quantum dynamics, and also very difficult to identify experimentally2–4. Hydrogenic systems, however, allow for accurate first-principles calculations. In this way the rate of the gas-phase proton-transfer tunnelling reaction of hydrogen molecules with deuterium anions, H2 + D− → H− + HD, has been calculated5, but has so far lacked experimental verification. Here we present high-sensitivity measurements of the reaction rate carried out in a cryogenic 22-pole ion trap. We observe an extremely low rate constant of (5.2 ± 1.6) × 10−20 cm3 s−1. This measured value agrees with quantum tunnelling calculations, serving as a benchmark for molecular theory and advancing the understanding of fundamental collision processes. A deviation of the reaction rate from linear scaling, which is observed at high H2 densities, can be traced back to previously unobserved heating dynamics in radiofrequency ion traps.},

An upper limit of the rate coefficient was found to be about 10−18cm3/s. In the present study, reaction probabilities are determined using the ABC program developed by Skouteris et al. [Comput. Phys. Commun. 133, 128 (2000)]. The probabilities for ortho-H2 and para-H2 in their ground rovibrational states are obtained numerically at collision energies above 50 meV with the total angular momentum J=0–15 and extrapolated below 50 meV using a WKB approach. Thermally averaged rate coefficients for ortho- and para-H2 are obtained; the largest one, for ortho-H2, is about 3.1×10−20cm3/s, which agrees with the experimental results.},

	abstract = {In cosmology, recombination refers to the epoch during which charged electrons and protons first became bound to form electrically neutral hydrogen atoms. Recombination occurred about 378,000 years after the Big Bang (at a redshift of z = 1100). The word "recombination" is misleading, since the Big Bang theory doesn't posit that protons and electrons had been combined before, but the name exists for historical reasons since it was named before the Big Bang hypothesis became the primary theory of the birth of the universe.
Immediately after the Big Bang, the universe was a hot, dense plasma of photons, leptons, and quarks: the quark epoch. At 10−6 seconds, the Universe had expanded and cooled sufficiently to allow for the formation of protons: the hadron epoch. This plasma was effectively opaque to electromagnetic radiation due to Thomson scattering by free electrons, as the mean free path each photon could travel before encountering an electron was very short. This is the current state of the interior of the Sun. As the universe expanded, it also cooled. Eventually, the universe cooled to the point that the formation of neutral hydrogen was energetically favored, and the fraction of free electrons and protons as compared to neutral hydrogen decreased to a few parts in 10,000.
Recombination involves electrons binding to protons (hydrogen nuclei) to form neutral hydrogen atoms. Because direct recombinations to the ground state (lowest energy) of hydrogen are very inefficient, these hydrogen atoms generally form with the electrons in a high energy state, and the electrons quickly transition to their low energy state by emitting photons. Two main pathways exist: from the 2p state by emitting a Lyman-a photon – these photons will almost always be reabsorbed by another hydrogen atom in its ground state – or from the 2s state by emitting two photons, which is very slow.This production of photons is known as decoupling, which leads to recombination sometimes being called photon decoupling, but recombination and photon decoupling are distinct events. Once photons decoupled from matter, they traveled freely through the universe without interacting with matter and constitute what is observed today as cosmic microwave background radiation (in that sense, the cosmic background radiation is infrared and some red black-body radiation emitted when the universe was at a temperature of some 3000 K, redshifted by a factor of 1100 from the visible spectrum to the microwave spectrum).},

The electronic continuum states are obtained with the complex-Kohn variational method. The benchmark calculation for the REA to the simplest negative ion CN−, which was recently observed in the interstellar medium, has produced a relatively low rate coefficient α(T)=7.3×10−16 cm3/s at T=30 K. Moreover, our results are shown to agree well with microscopic reversibility applied on a recent photodetachment experiment on CN−. Finally, the study confirms a previous assessment that the CN− ion is unlikely be formed by REA in the interstellar medium.},
