	abstract = {Quantum tunnelling reactions play an important role in chemistry when classical pathways are energetically forbidden1, be it in gas-phase reactions, surface diffusion or liquid-phase chemistry. In general, such tunnelling reactions are challenging to calculate theoretically, given the high dimensionality of the quantum dynamics, and also very difficult to identify experimentally2–4. Hydrogenic systems, however, allow for accurate first-principles calculations. In this way the rate of the gas-phase proton-transfer tunnelling reaction of hydrogen molecules with deuterium anions, H2 + D− → H− + HD, has been calculated5, but has so far lacked experimental verification. Here we present high-sensitivity measurements of the reaction rate carried out in a cryogenic 22-pole ion trap. We observe an extremely low rate constant of (5.2 ± 1.6) × 10−20 cm3 s−1. This measured value agrees with quantum tunnelling calculations, serving as a benchmark for molecular theory and advancing the understanding of fundamental collision processes. A deviation of the reaction rate from linear scaling, which is observed at high H2 densities, can be traced back to previously unobserved heating dynamics in radiofrequency ion traps.},

An upper limit of the rate coefficient was found to be about 10−18cm3/s. In the present study, reaction probabilities are determined using the ABC program developed by Skouteris et al. [Comput. Phys. Commun. 133, 128 (2000)]. The probabilities for ortho-H2 and para-H2 in their ground rovibrational states are obtained numerically at collision energies above 50 meV with the total angular momentum J=0–15 and extrapolated below 50 meV using a WKB approach. Thermally averaged rate coefficients for ortho- and para-H2 are obtained; the largest one, for ortho-H2, is about 3.1×10−20cm3/s, which agrees with the experimental results.},

Another group of results discussed in this paper deals with the dynamics of the growth of hydrogen clusters starting from H3+. In all cases, the influence of H2 rotation was examined by utilizing p-H2 and n-H2. Also the process of isotope fractionation in the presence of HD and D2 is briefly mentioned.},

	abstract = {Molecular absorption and emission bands dominate the visible, infrared, and submillimeter spectra of most objects with associated gas. These observations reveal a surprisingly rich array of molecular species and attest to a complex chemistry taking place in the harsh environment of the interstellar medium of galaxies. Molecules are truly everywhere and an important component of interstellar gas. This review surveys molecular observations in the various spectral windows and summarizes the chemical and physical processes involved in the formation and evolution of interstellar molecules. The rich organic inventory of space reflects the multitude of chemical processes involved that, on the one hand, build up molecules an atom at a time and, on the other hand, break down large molecules injected by stars to smaller fragments. Both this bottom-up and the trickle-down chemistry are reviewed. The emphasis is on understanding the characteristics of complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules and fullerenes and their role in chemistry as well as the intricate interaction of gas-phase ion-molecule and neutral-neutral reactions and the chemistry taking place on grain surfaces in dense clouds in setting the organic inventory of regions of star and planet formation and their implications for the chemical history of the Solar System. Many aspects of molecular astrophysics are illustrated with recent observations of the HIFI instrument on the Herschel Space Observatory.},

From these data the lifetime of the transient SN2 complex has been derived as a function of temperature.

This paper presents a tutorial on radiofrequency ion trapping in multipole electrode configurations.

In addition, selected experimental studies on cation and anion–molecule reactions and on spectroscopy of trapped ions are reviewed.

	abstract = {The system of reactions H3++HD↔H2D++H2 has been studied in a low-temperature multipole ion trap at a nominal temperature of 10K. The rate coefficient k1 for the forward reaction has been found to be 3.5×10−10cm3s−1 at 10K, a value significantly smaller than the currently accepted value of 1.5×10−9cm3s−1. The rate coefficient k−1 for the backward reaction has been found to be much higher than the value derived from the equilibrium coefficient of ∼10−18cm3s1. For normal-hydrogen, a value of k−1=4.9×10−11cm3s−1 has been deduced while for almost pure para-hydrogen (purity 99±1\%) the value drops to k−1=7.3×10−13cm3s−1. The results are discussed on the basis of the well-known energy levels of the involved molecules and the potential energy surface of the H4D+ intermediate. Zero-point energy plays a key role; however, there are additional complications due to the formation of rotationally excited H2D+, if even traces of ortho-H2 (o-H2) are present. The consequences of the results for the chemistry of cold clouds are illustrated using an evolutive gas-phase chemical model. There is strong evidence, that the new results significantly reduce the efficiency of isotope fractionation via gas-phase reactions. The experimental results also indicate the need for state-to-state rate coefficients in order to correctly simulate the o-H2 induced non-equilibrium conditions prevailing both in the low temperature ion trap and in interstellar clouds.},
